Syllabus:

- Week 1 Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy

In this module, we introduce how to conduct exploratory data analysis with popular libraries: `Pandas` and `Numpy`. Data Scientists usually conduct exploratory analyses before they choose specific algorithms. `Pandas` makes it convenient to load, process and analyze tabular data.



- Week 2 Data Visualization 

We discuss popular data visualization libraries `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`  in this module. Visualization makes it easier for data scientists or analysts to get a preliminary idea or intuition on choosing algorithms.



- Week 3 Solving prediction problems. - OLS and Maximum Likelihood

We introduce the conventional ways to solve the optimization problems of regressions in this module. Among talking about the process of optimization, we cover the calculations of important terms,  such as variance, bias, squared error, overfitting, and loss function. We also talk about the assumptions for linear regressions.

Participants are required to review basic linear algebra calculations and basic calculus methods before the start of the class.



- Week 4 Solving classification problems. - Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a method of classifying data into discrete results. In this module, we introduced the concept of classification, the cost function of logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression in multi-class classification.



- Week 5 Regression Regularization, Pros and Cons

We introduce regularization, which helps prevent the model from overfitting the training data. We also discuss the pros and cons using logistic regression to solve classification problems.



- Week 6 Solving classification problems- Decision Tree, KNN

In this module, we introduce two non-parametric methods to solve classification problems - decision tree and k-nearest-neighbors



- Week 7 Ensembles - Bagging, Random Forest, Feature Importance

We discuss ensemble of models in this module.



- Week 8 Feature Engineering and feature Selection

We discuss the transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling, and methods to remove unnecessary features.

- Week 9 Support Vector Machine

Support vector machine or SVM is a machine learning algorithm used for classification. We introduce the ideas and intuition behind SVM, and discussed how to use it in practice.



- Week 10 Unsupervised Learning - PCA and Clustering 

We discuss how to reduce the dimensionality of the original data and the main methods of grouping similar data points.



- Week 11 Large Scale Machine Learning 

Machine learning works best when there is a lot of data available for training. In this module, we discuss how to apply machine learning algorithms to large data sets.



- Week 12 Time Series Analysis Basics

We cover the conventional econometric approach and machine learning methods to deal with time series data.



- Week 13 Time Series Analysis Application

We introduce the Prophet Forecasting model for time series predictions, forecast quality evaluations, and visualizations.



- Week 14 Gradient Boosting

In this module, we discuss the history, algorithm of gradient boosting, and the loss functions.

Instructor Bio: Each instructor should be familiar with the  topic's contents proposed by the lead instructor. Each lead instructor should not only design most teaching contents of the topics, but also have empirical experience and be able to answer participants questions. Instructors are also strongly encouraged to discuss questions proposed by participants in the Slack group or Wechat group. Participants are also encouraged to help other participants with content-related questions proposed in the public channel.
